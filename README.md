In this example, the mergeCars function uses the spread syntax (...) to merge the properties of both car objects into a new object. The resulting mergedCar object will have properties from both car1 and car2.


To run this code in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Create a new file and save it with a .js extension, for example, mergeCars.js.
Copy and paste the code into the file.
Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (you can do this by pressing Ctrl + `).
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the cd command.
Run the script using the node command followed by the filename:
like this 
node mergeCars.js
and it will display the output.
